# searchTerms

> There are three types of search terms:
>
> - Keywords: Test these in [https://bsky.app/search](https://bsky.app/search). `AND` is implicit, so `light microscopy` on one line will require both `light` and `microscopy`. You can use quotes as well `"light microscopy"`.
> - Users: links such as `https://bsky.app/profile/why.bsky.team` will pull in the user's posts. To include replies and reposts, you can add the following flags: `https://bsky.app/profile/why.bsky.team +replies +reposts`.
